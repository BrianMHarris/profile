        As a kid in the 90's, I got hooked on coding through creating little apps for AOL.

        After studying Game Design and Development at Full Sail University, I spent 11 years in game design-related roles. I snuck in scripting as often I could.

        As of 2017 I am again following my passion. In web development I get to use my imagination and skills to create and share incredible things.
