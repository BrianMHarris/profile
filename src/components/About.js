        <p>
          As a kid in the 90's, I got hooked on coding by creating small games and
          apps for AOL.

          After studying Game Design and Development at Full Sail University,
          I spent 11 years in game design-related roles. I snuck in
          scripting as often I could.

        <p>
          As of 2017 I am again following my passion. In web development
          I get to use my skills and imagination to bring amazing things
          to life.
